# React + Vite

My Harry Potter Character App is a React-Project that allows users to browse a list of characters, view their details such as Gender, House, wand and mark them as favorites. The application uses localStorage for favorite selections, allows users to maintain their favorites even after refreshing the page.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
