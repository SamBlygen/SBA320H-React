# SBA320H-React

My Harry Potter Character App is a React-Project that allows users to browse a list of characters, view their details such as Gender, House, wand and mark them as favorites. The application uses localStorage for favorite selections, allows users to maintain their favorites even after refreshing the page.


My Project uses  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, useState and UseEffect. REACT for user interaction, react- dom to help to render the components and react-router-dom to navigate between different components in my application without reloading the page.

Uses Vite for fast build and development
